        <center><h3> Recite AI can take your PDF files, notes, books and recite them you in a variety of 
            voices, tones and languages. You'll be able to take your downloadable file anywhere and listen on

            <center><h2> This project was built as a means to explore Text to Speech (TTS) applications and how we 
                can leverage the power of modern neural network architectures to create meaningful products for consumers to use.
                Recite, was first built using gTTS (Google's Text to Speech App) while I trained my network on multiple open sourced data sets. 
                You will see I used a variety of datasets from Hugging Face, Kaggle and other open sources to build my model.
            </h2> </center>
            <center><h3> In addition to training the model and creating a machine learning application for consumers to use, I also built 
                the end to end data processing pipelines using Python, Pandas and other useful tools. 
            </h3></center>
           <center><h3>I built this website from the ground up, I hope you enjoy!</h3></center>
